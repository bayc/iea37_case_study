We're performing layout optimization using a nested hybrid method that uses both gradient-free and gradient-based algorithms.
This nested approach is shown in Fig.~\ref{xdsm_for_GA}
We first use a gradient-free method, such as a GA or PSO, to choose the number of turbines in each of the distinct regions.
Then, a greedy placement algorithm is used to seed the initial turbine locations intelligently.
Those turbine locations are used as the starting points for a gradient-based method, such as SNOPT, which directly maximizes AEP while controlling the turbine locations subject to boundary and spacing constraints.

Once the gradient-based optimizer is converged to a reasonable tolerance, the locally optimal AEP value is passed back to the gradient-free optimizer.
The gradient-free optimizer is only varying the number of turbines in each region while attempting to maximize AEP.
The gradient-based method only passes optimal AEP values to the gradient-free method.
Essentially, the outer optimizer is providing intelligent turbine placement for the inner optimizer.

We have preliminary results for a simplified version of the problem and are working towards the full case4 study.
